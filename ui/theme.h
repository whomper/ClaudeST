 * app (one selection colour: P_SEL); an app adds its own meaning colours after them (EFTP's folder, up and

 *
 * 256 colours: the roles take pens 16 and up, set to the RGB below and put back at exit (the desktop's sixteen
 * are never touched: 5.2). 16 colours: each role is the pen nearest its `want16` among the screen's own
 * sixteen (pen_nearest: NVDI's are not TOS's, a TT's 9 to 14 are light where a Falcon's are dark), never a fixed
 * number. Monochrome and 4 colours: P_PANEL is pen 0, everything else pen 1; the selection is inverse.
 * `colour` is 0 there, and when the app's option turns colour off.
