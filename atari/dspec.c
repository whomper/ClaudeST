 * XBIOS while a job runs; a busy or missing DSP means BearSSL does it.
 * A job is one key exchange or signature: thousands of commands, up to
 * about a second on a stock Falcon. Every 40 ms of it the 68030 goes back
 * to user mode for a turn of pf_idle (the guidelines' Speed: EUpdate's
 * handshakes held a stock Falcon 1.3 to 1.7 s), the DSP kept locked and
 * waiting where it was: another program's job meanwhile finds it busy
 * and does its own with BearSSL. The turns come by the clock, not by the
 * commands, and the commands don't depend on the secret.
